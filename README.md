Weltmeister Plugins
====================

Even the greatest tools can use some extensions and improvements.
These are some of my personal plugins/injections to [ImpactJS](http://impactjs.com/)'s editor called [Weltmeister](http://impactjs.com/documentation/weltmeister).

## Requirements

The latest impactjs from the repo found on your impactjs download page.
If you can't upgrade, for whatever reason, you can check out the [DEPRECATED readme](https://github.com/jeroenverfallie/wm-plugins/blob/master/DEPRECATED.md) but this is **NOT** recommended!! 

## Installation ##

Simply get these plugins, place them where you like, and include them through the config file.

```
plugins: ['weltmeister.plugins.save-extra', 'weltmeister.plugins.floodfill', '...']
```
